Nature is the collection of all living and non-living things that surround us. It includes forests, rivers, mountains, animals, and even the air we breathe. Forests provide oxygen and are home to many species of plants and animals. Rivers supply fresh water, which is essential for life. Mountains shape the land and influence weather patterns. Animals play important roles in ecosystems, helping plants reproduce and keeping populations balanced. Protecting nature is important because it provides food, water, and clean air for humans and all living beings.
